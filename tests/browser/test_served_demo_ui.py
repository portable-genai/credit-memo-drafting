"""F2: the presenter demo is driven through a real headless browser, not a string.

``scripts/demo_selftest.py`` starts the real server and reads the served bytes, which
covers the server/renderer path browserlessly. This file closes the other half: a pinned
headless Chromium loads the SERVED pages, clicks the presenter's own ``Next`` button, and
reads every asserted figure back out of the LIVE DOM through the stable ``data-*``
evidence hooks. Nothing here is compared against hard-coded prose; every expectation is
recomputed from the running :class:`DemoSession`.

Playwright is pinned in the ``[demo]`` extra and the browser binary is a network download,
so a fork's day-one offline gate (D3) must not depend on either: with nothing set, an absent
extra or an unlaunchable browser still skips LOUDLY (``-rs``, as ``make demo-browser`` runs
it) rather than passing silently. That default is a courtesy to a clean checkout, not a
licence. Set ``DEMO_BROWSER_REQUIRED`` and the same conditions FAIL instead, because a suite
that declines to run reports exactly the green a suite that ran reports, and a runner that
installed a browser on purpose is the one place that must never be handed a skip.
``CHROME_PATH`` names the binary to drive, the same read
``scripts/credit_memo_demo_playwright.py`` makes, so a runner carrying its own chromium is driven
rather than quietly ignored.

#: nothing for anyone who leaves it alone. It was NOT honoured here before, and a runner that ships
#: a distribution chromium and exports ``CHROME_PATH`` was therefore ignored: the launch reached
#: for a download that was not there and the suite skipped. Two-state on purpose, and classified
#: posture-free alongside the other ``CHROME_PATH`` read: it names a program on the runner's own
#: machine, never a host, an origin or an audience, and an unusable value fails the launch loudly

#: * UNSET: nobody said one was expected, so a launch failure may still skip and a day-one
#:   offline checkout with no ``[demo]`` extra keeps a clean gate;
#: * SET AND EMPTY: an intent WAS expressed and it names nothing, so ``boolean_setting``
#:   refuses rather than guessing which way it pointed;
#: * SET AND TRUE: a browser was promised, so an absent extra or a failed launch FAILS.
#:
#: The last state is why this variable exists. A suite that declines to run reports exactly
#: the green a suite that ran reports, so the one place this evidence must never be allowed to
#: skip is the place that installed a browser on purpose.
