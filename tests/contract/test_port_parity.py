"""Contract tests: the ``onprem`` and ``local`` adapters are structural parity of the ports.

For every port the catalog declares, this iterates the adapter map and, for both the
``onprem`` and ``local`` profiles, imports + constructs the bound class (which must build
cleanly with **no Google Cloud SDK** installed), then asserts:

  1. the constructed instance satisfies its runtime_checkable Protocol (isinstance), and
  2. every method/property the Protocol declares actually exists on the instance.

It additionally proves the two profiles' distinct contracts:

* ``onprem`` is the fail-fast Google Distributed Cloud migration target: every method
  raises ``NotImplementedError`` (proven on a representative port), and
* ``local`` is a WORKING offline stack: the same ports construct and answer in-process.

This is the proof of the ports-and-adapters / no-lock-in promise (P-02): the on-prem
migration target and the offline local stack implement the exact same interface as the
managed GCP stack.
