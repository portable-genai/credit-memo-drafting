"""Document AI may sit in a named multi-region, and in nothing else.

`infra/terraform/variables.tf` has validated `docai_location` since the region move: the
deploy region or a named multi-region, `global` refused by name. The runtime carried no such
check, so the two halves of one decision disagreed. An operator who set
`CREDIT_MEMO_DOCAI_LOCATION=global` got an unlocated processor silently: the value reached the
adapter, `/healthz` still reported `asia-southeast1`, and a borrower's financial statements
were parsed somewhere the residency record cannot name. `global` is precisely what someone
reaches for to make a failing single-region call succeed, which is why refusing it has to
happen where the value is read rather than only where the processor is created.

The rule is the one `loan-document-intelligence` already enforces, and the one Terraform
already enforces beside it:

* the deploy region is allowed, and is the preferred state;
* a named MULTI-REGION is allowed, because it names one jurisdiction and carries Google's
  ML-processing commitment for that geography;
* everything else is refused, including `global`, which names no jurisdiction, and including
  another single region, which is neither the deploy region nor a multi-region commitment.

Document AI is the only field this binds. `models.location` and `knowledge_base.location` are
separate axes with their own stated deviations, and a guard that reached them would break the
shipped configuration: Agent Search serves no Cloud region at all, so the knowledge base's
`global` is a recorded absence of a jurisdiction rather than a widening away from one.
