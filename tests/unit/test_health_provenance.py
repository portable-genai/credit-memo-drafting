"""The banner's server half: this service names its runtime and its model.

Every served UI in the fleet states, at the top of every page, where it is running and
which model answers (org decision, 2026-08-30). The console must never infer either. A
page that read its runtime from ``window.location`` would be right until the deployment
served through a proxy, and wrong silently after that; a page that hard-coded a model name
would keep printing it after the binding changed.

So the service answers, and the answer is DERIVED FROM THE BINDING the container will
actually build rather than from a second field someone has to remember to update. That is
the property these tests pin: rebinding ``llm`` for a profile has to change what the banner
says, in the same edit.
