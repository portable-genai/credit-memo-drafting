"""The Model Armor adapter blocks on a match, and fails closed on no verdict or an API error.

It also fails closed on an INCOMPLETE screen: ``invocation_result`` ``PARTIAL`` or
``FAILURE`` means some or all filters were skipped or failed, and a skipped filter reports
``NO_MATCH_FOUND``. Padding a prompt past the prompt-injection filter's token limit would
otherwise get it through unscreened, so only ``NO_MATCH_FOUND`` with ``SUCCESS`` allows.

The mapping this replaces was ``allowed = match_name != "MATCH_FOUND"`` with a ``str()``
fallback for the name: a response with no ``sanitization_result`` became ``"None"`` and was
ALLOWED, as were ``UNSPECIFIED``, ``PARTIAL`` and ``FAILURE``. The sanitize calls also had no
deadline.

This module tests at two levels:

* **SDK-free** (always runs, including where CI has no ``google-cloud-modelarmor``): the
  mapping is fed ``_MirrorState`` / ``_MirrorInvocation``, stdlib ``IntEnum`` s with the real
  member names and numbers, so they have the same ``str()`` behaviour as the proto-plus enums.
* **Real SDK** (runs where ``google-cloud-modelarmor`` is installed, skips otherwise):
  responses are built from the real ``modelarmor_v1`` types and screened through ``screen()``
  with a fake client, so nothing touches the network. The first of these tests also pins the
  mirror to the real enum, so the SDK-free half cannot drift.
