"""No em-dash in the text the demo pages and the domain put in front of a reader.

Business-facing text carries no em-dash. Outside the console, three places write it: the
static demo renderer, the presenter demo server's page chrome, and the domain, whose
headings, reasons and refusals reach the console and anything exported. Comments, docstrings
and presenter narration are not shown to a buyer and may carry one. The console's own text is
held by ``ui/tests/visible-text-has-no-em-dash.test.mjs``.

The check parses each module and reads only its string literals, so a docstring is never
mistaken for text on a page, and a lone placeholder for an empty cell is caught the same way a
heading is. Prompt templates are left out: a model reads them, not a person.
