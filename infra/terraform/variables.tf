# variables.tf — The only knobs. Everything else is a concrete in-region value.

# General Principle map:
#   P-05 (residency): `region` is SELECTED AT DEPLOY TIME and validated against the
#         residency allowlist (var.allowed_regions) so a caller fails fast rather than
#         deploying to an unvetted, out-of-jurisdiction region. The default is
#         asia-southeast1 (Singapore).
#   P-07 (auditability/retention): `retention_days` is a Terraform variable (the WORM
#         bucket lock is irreversible, so retention must be deliberate).
#
# Per the build contract, ONLY project_id and a couple of genuinely per-tenant values
# (org/billing ids, the VPC-SC toggle) are variables. All service identifiers, locations
# and template names are concrete. The governed RAG store lives in A2, not here.

    Value groups for the gcp.resourceLocations Org Policy. Empty (the default) derives the

    Widen it ONLY where a service this stack genuinely needs has no presence at single-region
    granularity, and treat the width as the residency claim rather than as plumbing. Two
    services in this catalog force the question:

      * Agent Search serves `global`, `us` and `eu` and NO Cloud region at all.
      * Document AI serves the deploy region only once Google grants single-region access,
        and routes to the `us` multi-region until then.

    Move to the smallest value group that still describes ONE JURISDICTION -- `in:us-locations`
    keeps every resource inside the United States -- and state the residency claim at that
    granularity rather than pretending it is still single-region. NEVER list an individual
    foreign region to unblock one service: that turns a jurisdiction boundary into a list of
    exceptions nobody can reason about.

    NOT YET VERIFIED BY EXECUTION: whether a `global` Agent Search data store is subject to
    this constraint at all, or is exempt as a global resource. Confirm at first apply and
    record the answer rather than guessing; the failure mode if it IS subject is an apply
    error naming discoveryengine, which is the good kind of failure.

variable "docai_location" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Where the Document AI processor is CREATED. Deliberately NOT var.region.

    Document AI does not serve every Cloud region, and creating a processor in one it does not
    serve 404s at apply. It DOES serve asia-southeast1 -- and serves no us-central1 endpoint at
    all -- but Singapore is "limited support": a subset of processors, several in Preview, and
    access is gated behind Google's Document AI Single Region Request Form. Until that request
    is granted this routes to the `us` MULTI-REGION, which is a stated residency deviation:
    document bytes are extracted in the United States while the rest of the stack stays in
    region. Set this to asia-southeast1 the day access lands.

    Keep it equal to the runtime's CREDIT_MEMO_DOCAI_LOCATION, which selects the same location for
    the adapter. If the two disagree, Terraform creates the processor in one location and the
    adapter looks for it in another, and the failure surfaces as a confusing 404 at request
    time rather than at apply.

    `us` and `eu` are multi-regions, not `global`: each names ONE jurisdiction. Never widen
    this to a location the service does not serve just to make an apply succeed. Whichever is
    chosen, gcp.resourceLocations must be wide enough to permit it (see var.resource_location_values), and the
    residency claim must be stated at that width rather than at var.region's.
