# variables.tf — The only knobs. Everything else is a concrete in-region value.
#
# General Principle map:
#   P-05 (residency): `region` is SELECTED AT DEPLOY TIME and validated against the
#         residency allowlist (var.allowed_regions) so a caller fails fast rather than
#         deploying to an unvetted, out-of-jurisdiction region. The default is
#         asia-southeast1 (Singapore).
#   P-07 (auditability/retention): `retention_days` is a Terraform variable (the WORM
#         bucket lock is irreversible, so retention must be deliberate).
#
# Per the build contract, ONLY project_id and a couple of genuinely per-tenant values
# (org/billing ids, the VPC-SC toggle) are variables. All service identifiers, locations
# and template names are concrete. The governed RAG store lives in A2, not here.

    the deliberate residency review point: do it only after confirming the full managed stack
    (Document AI, DLP, Model Armor, Vertex/Agent Platform, BigQuery, CMEK, Logging) and your
