# agent_runtime.tf — placeholder for the Agent Runtime (reasoningEngine) deploy.
#
# General Principle map:
#   P-01 (managed-first): the ADK agent is hosted on Agent Runtime (ex-Agent Engine), a
#         reasoningEngine resource, rather than self-managed infra.
#   P-05 (residency): the reasoningEngine is created in asia-southeast1.
#
# The reasoningEngine itself is created by the Agent Platform SDK at deploy time (see
# src/credit_memo/agent/root_agent.py docstring), not by Terraform, because the build
# artifact is a packaged Python agent. This file reserves the staging bucket and records the
# runtime identity so settings.agent_engine.resource_name can be set after deploy.
# verify: https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/deploy
