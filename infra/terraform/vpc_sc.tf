# vpc_sc.tf — VPC Service Controls perimeter around the AI/data plane.
#
# General Principle map:
#   P-05 (residency + exfiltration control): a service perimeter draws a logical boundary
#         around the sovereignty-critical APIs (Vertex/Agent Platform, Document AI, Agent
#         Search backing A2, BigQuery, DLP, Model Armor, Logging, KMS, Secret Manager,
#         Storage). Borrower data cannot be read across the boundary to a non-Singapore
#         project, which is what stops the filings and audit log from leaving the country.
#   P-01 (least surface): only the services B2 uses are inside the perimeter.
#
# Guarded by var.enable_vpc_sc so non-prod/dev applies can skip it (count = 0).
#
# DEPLOY-ORDER CAVEAT:
#   The perimeter blocks API calls from outside it. If you enable this BEFORE the resources
#   in the other files are created (or before your Terraform runner / CI identity is added
#   to the perimeter's access levels), those API calls will be denied and the apply will
#   fail. Recommended order:
#     1. Apply everything with enable_vpc_sc = false.
#     2. Add your operator/CI identity to an access level.
#     3. Re-apply with enable_vpc_sc = true to enforce the boundary.
#   # verify: VPC-SC dry-run mode before enforcing.
