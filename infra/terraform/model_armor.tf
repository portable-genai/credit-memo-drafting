# model_armor.tf — Model Armor guardrail template (rule R1).
#
# General Principle map:
#   P-04 / R1 (guardrail screening): the guardrail adapter (model_armor_guardrail) screens
#         every inbound prompt and outbound memo through this template for prompt injection,
#         jailbreak, sensitive-data leakage and malicious URLs. Because B2 handles borrower
#         financial/PII data, this screen is mandatory in both directions.
#   P-05 (residency): the template is created in asia-southeast1 and called on the regional
#         Model Armor host (modelarmor.asia-southeast1.rep.googleapis.com).
