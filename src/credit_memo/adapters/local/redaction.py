"""Local PII redaction adapter (PIIRedactionPort) — regex de-identification.

The ``local`` profile's stand-in for **Sensitive Data Protection / DLP** (and the A1
gateway redactor): masks the national identifiers for the configured jurisdiction(s) plus
universal email/phone with deterministic regexes, returning findings. Borrower PII is
removed at the boundary before it reaches a model, a trace span or the audit sink (P-04,
rule R1). The pattern set is jurisdiction-driven (``settings.pii.jurisdictions``, default
SG/HK/JP/AU) so a non-APAC deployment detects its own identifiers by config, not a code
change. There is no Google emulator for DLP, so this path is unconditional and imports no
google-cloud package.

The rows and their checksum validators come from the shared ``pii-kit`` package, NOT a
local copy: this redactor, the DLP adapter and the eval leak-check all read the SAME rows,
so a pattern fix is a version bump rather than a copy that drifts out of sync (a copy that
drifts narrows rows silently, and a narrowed row leaks identifiers no gate can see).

Rows that carry a checksum validator (JP My Number, AU TFN) mask only genuine identifiers,
so the ordinary digit runs a filing is full of (facility amounts, account and invoice
references) are left intact rather than falsely redacted out of the memo. B2 has no
bank-account row, so the universal email/phone rows lead and the national-id rows follow
with no bare-digit catch-all and therefore no row-ordering hazard.
