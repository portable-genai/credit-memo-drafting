"""Model Armor guardrail adapter (GuardrailPort, A1, rule R1).

Screens inbound credit-memo prompts and outbound memo text through **Model Armor** on the
regional host ``modelarmor.asia-southeast1.rep.googleapis.com`` via ``sanitizeUserPrompt``
/ ``sanitizeModelResponse``: prompt-injection, jailbreak, sensitive-data and malicious-URL
detection. Because B2 handles borrower financial/PII data, this screen is mandatory in both
directions (rule R1).

FAIL CLOSED. The verdict is ALLOWED only when ``filter_match_state`` is ``NO_MATCH_FOUND``
AND ``invocation_result`` is ``SUCCESS``, each read by the enum member's ``.name``.
``invocation_result`` is set independently of the match state: ``PARTIAL`` (some filters were
skipped or failed) and ``FAILURE`` (all were) arrive WITH ``NO_MATCH_FOUND``, because a skipped
filter reports no match. A missing ``sanitization_result``, an ``UNSPECIFIED`` state, a match,
or an incomplete screen all block. Every call carries a deadline
(``model_armor.timeout_seconds``), and an API error or timeout propagates to the caller.

All Google Cloud SDK imports are lazy so the on-prem / test profile imports this module
without ``google-cloud-modelarmor`` installed.
