"""A2A AgentCard registry adapter (AgentRegistryPort, A3, rule R4).

Serves and resolves B2's A2A AgentCard locally (the same minimal A2A shape the
``agent-registry`` service stores). In a standalone deployment the card is published
at ``/.well-known/agent-card.json`` by the API; this adapter holds an in-process registry
of cards so the agent can self-register and resolve peers without the platform registry.
The ``platform`` adapter delegates to the shared A3 service over HTTP.

This adapter imports no Google Cloud SDK; it is a thin in-process registry.
