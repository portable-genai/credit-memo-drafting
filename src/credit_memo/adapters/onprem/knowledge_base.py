"""On-prem placeholder for ``KnowledgeBaseClientPort`` — the sovereign target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the platform profile
this port binds to the A2 Enterprise KB HTTP client; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem``
rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and
structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests
prove interface parity. ``ingest`` / ``search`` deliberately raise rather than silently
dropping a filing or returning empty grounding: an unimplemented governed RAG store must
never quietly de-fang the memo. Filling these bodies in is the only change required.
