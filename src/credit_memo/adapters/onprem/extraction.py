"""On-prem placeholder for ``DocumentExtractionPort`` — the sovereign target.

One of the reversibility (P-02, P-12) migration placeholders: in the managed profile
this port binds to the Document AI adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem`` rebinds
it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and
structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter, so the contract tests
prove interface parity. Porting B2 on-premise is *only* a matter of filling these bodies
in: the domain orchestration and service callers do not change.
