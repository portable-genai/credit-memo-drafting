# Adopting this repo as your base

This repository is a **common base** that BFSI institutions (and other regulated industries)
fork to build their own document-diligence agents: credit-memo / underwriting review,
CDD / KYC, trade-finance checking, insurance-claims triage, ESG due diligence. It ships a
reusable hexagonal core (a pure-stdlib domain, typed ports, swappable adapter profiles, a green
offline gate) plus a fully worked credit-memo / underwriting vertical you can keep, replace, or
learn from.

This guide is the step-by-step for making it yours. It has two halves: a **mechanical rebrand**
(one script) and the **human decisions** the script cannot make for you.

## 1. What you keep vs what you rewrite

The domain is split so the boundary is explicit, into vertical-neutral machinery, bank-owned
policy, and the credit-memo vertical:

| Layer | Where | For a new vertical |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel surface** (vertical-neutral intent) | `domain/kernel.py` names reusable evidence, safety and model-boundary contracts, but currently re-exports them from the mixed `domain/models.py` | keep the contract stable; a full split still requires moving the neutral definitions into the kernel |
| **Policy** (your numbers) | `policy.covenant_at_risk_band` in `config/settings.yaml`, injected through the shared API/ADK composition root | change by config, not code |
| **Vertical** (credit-memo artifacts) | the artifact models in `domain/models.py` (`Borrower`, `Covenant`, `RiskFlag`, `CreditMemo`, `PeerComparison`), the narrating services, the prompts, the local fixtures, the eval golden set, the UI memo views | rewrite for your artifacts |

The named `domain/kernel.py` import surface now exists, but the neutral definitions and vertical
artifacts still originate in one `domain/models.py`; completing that dependency inversion remains
audit check A7. Until then, treat the type list above as the compatibility seam.

If your product is another *document-diligence* vertical, most of the neutral machinery and the
deterministic engines transfer directly; you replace the artifact models and the prompts, and
retune the policy and taxonomy.

## 2. Core-vs-adopter-owned files (so upstream merges stay mechanical)

Upstream keeps evolving these; avoid diverging from them so you can pull fixes cleanly:

- **Upstream-owned** (take our changes): the neutral types in `domain/models.py`, `ports/`,
  `tests/contract/`, the eval harness (`eval/run_eval.py` mechanics), CI workflows, and the
  hexagon wiring (`config.py` `Container`).
- **Adopter-owned** (yours; expect to edit): `config/settings.yaml` *values*, the local fixtures,
  `adapters/onprem/*`, UI theming / branding, the golden eval dataset
  (`eval/datasets/golden_cases.jsonl`), and the `COMPLIANCE.md` jurisdiction rows.

Track upstream via git tags; rebase your adopter-owned
changes onto each release rather than merging `main` continuously.

## 3. The mechanical rebrand (one script)

`scripts/rename_fork.py` rewrites the package name (`credit_memo`), the CLI entry point
(`credit-memo`), the `CREDIT_MEMO_` env prefix, and the resource ids (`credit-memo-drafting`,
distribution `credit-memo-drafting`) across the tree in one pass. Preview first, then apply:

```bash
# Preview (writes nothing):
python scripts/rename_fork.py --package acme_underwriting --cli acme-uw \
    --env-prefix ACME --resource acme-underwriting --dry-run

# Apply:
python scripts/rename_fork.py --package acme_underwriting --cli acme-uw \
    --env-prefix ACME --resource acme-underwriting --yes

# Then recreate the environment (the distribution name changed) and prove it is green:
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
make lint test eval
```

Add `--include-docs` to sweep Markdown prose too. The script deliberately does NOT touch the
human decisions below.

## 4. The human decisions (the script can't make these)

1. **Region / residency.** Set the region (default `asia-southeast1`, Singapore / MAS) and the
   Terraform `region` / `tfvars` to your in-country region, and set `CREDIT_MEMO_KMS_KEY` to a
   regional CMEK key. See [`docs/runbook.md`](runbook.md) and
   [`docs/onprem-migration.md`](onprem-migration.md).
2. **Identity / IdP.** This repo owns no web login: on the managed profiles identity is the
   IAP-injected assertion (`adapters/gcp/iap_identity.py`), and `local` uses seeded dev personas.
   Wire your platform's IAP / identity in front and confirm the verified `Principal` is what the
   entitlement checks read. See [`docs/embedding-and-identity.md`](embedding-and-identity.md).
3. **PII / jurisdiction pack.** Set `pii.jurisdictions` (and `CREDIT_MEMO_PII_JURISDICTIONS` for
   the eval gate) so redaction and the `pii_safety` metric detect YOUR national identifiers.
   Supported today: SG, HK, JP, AU (from the shared `pii-kit`). Add a market to the pack if
   yours is not yet listed.
4. **Risk / covenant policy.** Own `policy.covenant_at_risk_band` in
   `config/settings.yaml`. The shared composition root injects it into both API and ADK memo
   services; the default is a reference, not your policy. Add further owned thresholds through the
   same typed settings seam rather than hard-coding them.
5. **Reference data is fictional.** Every fixture and figure use obviously-fake names
   (`Acme Manufacturing (FICTIONAL)`). Swap the fixtures for your own
   synthetic data. **Do not run against live borrower data without your own legal, security and
   model-risk sign-off.**
6. **Eval golden set.** Rebuild `eval/datasets/golden_cases.jsonl` and the rubrics for your
   vertical: a fork inherits a green gate that measures the WRONG thing until you do. The gate
   structure is generic; the golden cases are yours.
7. **Deployment posture.** Review the Dockerfile (digest-pinned base, non-root `appuser`, port
   `8093`), `infra/terraform/` (CMEK, VPC-SC, the 15-day analysis bucket), and the loopback-by-default binding
   before you expose anything. CI now runs Terraform fmt/init/validate and the module carries an
   Org Policy resource-location allowlist; named apply and live enforcement evidence remain yours.

## 5. Do not duplicate the platform

This repo is one system in a catalog of composable GRC systems. Several concerns it *touches* are
owned by sibling platform services, and you should integrate rather than rebuild them (see
[`docs/faq/features-faq.md`](faq/features-faq.md) for the full map): the guardrail gateway
(Hrz1), the governed knowledge base (Hrz2), the agent registry (Hrz3), the AI-quality / eval gate
(Hrz4), observability + audit (Hrz5), the maker-checker review console (Hrz7, rule R8), the
compliance assistant (Rsk1), and the on-prem DLP gate (Rsk6). The `platform` profile's adapters
are already thin HTTP clients to those services.

## 6. Adoption checklist

- [ ] Ran `scripts/rename_fork.py`, recreated the venv, `make lint test eval` green.
- [ ] Set region + Terraform tfvars to your in-country region; set `CREDIT_MEMO_KMS_KEY`.
- [ ] Confirmed your IAP / identity front-end resolves the verified `Principal`.
- [ ] Set `pii.jurisdictions` + added a pack market if needed; `pii_safety` exercises your ids.
- [ ] Owned the covenant / risk numbers with your credit function (lifted `_AT_RISK_BAND` into config).
- [ ] Replaced every synthetic fixture.
- [ ] Rebuilt the eval golden set + rubrics for your vertical.
- [ ] Reviewed the deploy posture (Dockerfile, Terraform, bind address); added the Terraform CI job.
- [ ] Decided which sibling platform services you integrate vs stub.
- [ ] Recorded your baseline upstream tag so you can take future fixes.
